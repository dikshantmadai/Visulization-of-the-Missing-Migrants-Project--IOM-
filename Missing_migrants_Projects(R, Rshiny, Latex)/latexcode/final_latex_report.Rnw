\begin{abstract}
This research examines data from the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project, presenting a graphic portrayal of the global tragedy of migrant fatalities and disappearances between 2014 and 2023. The data suggests that the Mediterranean Sea remains the most dangerous route, with a consistently high number of missing migrants. 2016 saw the largest number of missing migrants and deaths in a single year. Despite this sad reality, the number of survivors has fluctuated over time, with the highest number recorded in 2016.  A considerable gender disparity was seen across regions, with more males reporting missing than females.The Central Mediterranean route, particularly between Libya and Italy, has been highlighted as the most perilous area for migrants, with the highest number of missing people. Finally, the research ranks Afghanistan as the nation of origin with the highest number of migrant deaths, followed by Ethiopia, Mali, Algeria, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. This report aims to expose the global epidemic of missing migrants while also informing initiatives to improve safety and solve the challenges that individuals confront on their journeys.

\section{Introduction}
This dataset contains a detailed record of missing migrants and their tragic journeys to overseas destinations, gathered by the Missing Migrants Project, an initiative launched by the overseas Organization for Migration (IOM) in 2014. The collection tracks deaths and disappearances, shedding insight on the difficulties migrants confront on their journeys. Please keep in mind that because of the complexity of data collecting, the figures reported are most likely an undercount. The dataset is a monument to the individuals who died, as well as the families and communities affected by their absence.
This report uses data visualization to analyze patterns in migrant deaths and disappearances recorded by the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project. It aims to raise awareness of this global issue and inform efforts to improve migrant safety. The report explores trends by region, location, migration route, and country of origin. By visualizing the data, we can identify areas with the highest incidence of missing migrants and understand how these patterns have evolved over time.
Missing Migrants Project collects data through a variety of sources, including:The Missing

\section{Motivation and Objectives}

The Missing Migrants Project is a crucial resource for understanding the dangers faced by migrants worldwide. This report utilizes the project's data to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which regions have the highest number of migrant deaths and disappearances, and how do these numbers vary over time?
    \item What insights can we gain from analyzing the total number of missing migrants each year? which year is the highest number of the missing migrants and death.

    \item Trend in the Number of Survivors Over the Years. which year is the more Survivors?
    \item What is the gender ratio of missing migrants across different regions?
    \item Which is the top  impact location of death on number of missing migrants?
    \item Which migration route has the highest incidence of missing persons, and how does it compare to others?
    \item which is the most countries of origin by number of migrant deaths  ?
\end{itemize}

The data provides valuable insights  to guide policymakers and humanitarian organizations in their efforts to address migrant safety.

The heatmap shows the correlation between different variables related to migration incidents.There is also a strong positive correlation between the number of dead and the total number of dead and missing. The heatmap shows that there is a strong correlation between the number of deaths and the number of missing people. This suggests that as the number of deaths increases, the number of missing people also tends to increase.

over time}


The map shows the locations of migration incidents around the world. The color of the dots represents the number of incidents at each location. The red dots represent the highest number of incidents, while the blue dots represent the lowest number of incidents. The map shows that the majority of migration incidents occur in the Mediterranean Sea,  the South China Sea and more.

The graph depicts the number of missing migrants according on region. The Mediterranean region has the highest number of missing migrants, followed by North Africa and North America. The amount of missing migrants reduces as you go down the list, with Eastern Asia having the fewest. The graph indicates that missing migrants have a disproportionate impact in the Mediterranean region. This is most likely owing to the area's proximity to war zones and the large number of individuals attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe.

The graph shows the top 8 locations where missing migrants were found dead. The most common location is unspecified location between Libya and Italy, followed by Pima County, Arizona, USA and 120 miles south of Lampedusa. The data shows that the Mediterranean sea is the most dangerous route for migrants.

The graphs show the top migration routes by the number of missing people. The Central Mediterranean route is the most dangerous route, with 22018 missing people. The Sahara Desert crossing has 5773 missing people, and the US-Mexico border crossing has 4500 missing people. The other routes have fewer missing people. The graph shows that the Central Mediterranean route is by far the most dangerous route for migrants, with a significantly higher number of missing people than any other route.

The graph shows the top 10 countries of origin by number of migrant deaths. The country with the highest number of migrant deaths is Afghanistan, with 2369 deaths. This is followed by the Syrian Arab Republic with 1296 deaths and Eritrea with 1289 deaths. The graph shows that the majority of migrant deaths are from countries in the Middle East and Africa. These countries are often affected by conflict, poverty, and lack of opportunities, which can lead people to seek a better life in other countries.

\section{Summary}

\subsection*{1. Which regions have the highest number of migrant deaths and disappearances, and how do these numbers vary over time?}
\subsubsection*{1.1. expectation}
Data from 2014-2023 suggests the Mediterranean Sea route has consistently been the deadliest, with the highest number of deaths and disappearances. Over time there is a more number of missing migrants records \cite{file}
\subsubsection*{1.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
Over the time  Mediterranean Sea  has the highest number of death over the time.

\subsection*{2. What insights can we gain from analyzing the total number of missing migrants each year? which year is the highest number of the missing migrants and death.}
\subsubsection*{2.1. Expectation}
The total number of missing migrants each year provides insights into the scale and trends of migrant deaths and disappearances worldwide. The highest number of missing migrants and deaths in a single year was recorded in 2023, with at least 8,565 deaths.\cite{IOM}
\subsubsection*{2.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
The total number of missing migrants each year provides insights into the scale and trends of migrant deaths and disappearances worldwide and found that the highest number of missing migrants and deaths in a single year was recorded in 2016, with at least 8078 deaths.

\subsection*{3. Trend in the Number of Survivors Over the Years. which year is the more Survivors?}
\subsubsection*{3.1. Expectation}
Number of survivors has varied over the years. The highest number of survivors was recorded in 2023.\cite{IOM}
\subsubsection*{3.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
The number of survivors has varied over the years and found that the highest number of survivors was recorded in 2016 by 17113 survivors.


\subsection*{4. What are the gender ratios of missing migrants in different regions, and how do they vary across the globe?}
\subsubsection*{4.1. Expectation}
There are more male migrants reported missing than female migrants. This imbalance is particularly pronounced in certain regions, such as Southern Asia, where there are significantly more male migrants reported missing compared to female migrants and there is no record of missing migrants of central Asia.
Number of survivors has varied over the years. The highest number of survivors was recorded in 2023.\cite{IOM}
\subsubsection*{4.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
Yes,There are more male migrants reported missing than female migrants. This imbalance is particularly pronounced in certain regions, such as Southern Asia, where there are significantly more male migrants reported missing compared to female migrants and there is no record of missing migrants of central Asia.


\subsection*{5. Which is the top  impact location of death on number of missing migrants?}
\subsubsection*{5.1. Expectation}
The exact location with the highest number of missing migrants is the Mediterranean Sea, particularly the route between Libya and Italy. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), between 2014 and 2023, there were over 3129 reported deaths and disappearances of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea, with the majority occurring on the Central Mediterranean route between Libya and Italy.
Number of survivors has varied over the years. The highest number of survivors was recorded in 2023.\cite{MDP}
\subsubsection*{5.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
yes,  The exact location with the highest number of missing migrants is the Mediterranean Sea, particularly the route between Libya and Italy but it has the 1589 missing migrants.


\subsection*{6. Which migration route has the highest incidence of missing persons, and how does it compare to others?}
\subsubsection*{6.1. Expectation}
Central Mediterranean Sea highest incidence of missing persons, mostly  the route between Libya and Italy, has the highest incidence of missing persons.\cite{MDP}
\subsubsection*{6.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
yes Central Mediterranean Sea highest incidence of missing persons, mostly  the route between Libya and Italy, has the highest incidence of missing persons.

\subsection*{7. Which is the most countries of origin by number of migrant deaths ?}
\subsubsection*{7.1. Expectation}
The countries with the highest number of migrant deaths were those experiencing conflict and instability, particularly Afghanistan, Rohingya refugees, and countries in Africa.\cite{IOM}
\subsubsection*{7.2. What insights i get from my visualization}
Yes, the most migrant death countries of origin by number of migrant deaths are in Afghanistan.



This report shows us the sad reality of people trying to find a better life but facing danger and even death along the way. The Mediterranean Sea is the most dangerous place for these journeys, and there are more men missing than women and many more It's important to help people on these journeys and make sure they are safe. We need to understand why people are leaving their homes and work together to make the world a fairer place for everyone.
